classdef (Abstract) move
    %MOVE Base abstract class for movements that animals can use.
    %   This class forms the basis for all movement types that animals can
    %   use within their own objects.  As such it is abstract and will
    %   never be instantiated itself.

            %   in case it moves off the grid.  The animal is wrapped to
            %   the other side of the grid so is not lost.
