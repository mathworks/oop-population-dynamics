    %ORGANISM Base abstract class for plants and animals
    %   This class forms the basis for all organisms that we will be
    %   simulating within the world.  It is an abstract class in that we
    %   can not directly create an instance of this class but we do define
    %   common properties and methods that, if not defined here, must be
    %   defined in the subclasses - a concrete method.  For methods that
    %   are defined here we may, but do not have to, override them in our
    %   subclasses.
